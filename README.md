# EX-NO-11-ELLIPTIC-CURVE-CRYPTOGRAPHY-ECC

## Aim:
To Implement ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY(ECC)


## ALGORITHM:

1. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a public-key cryptography technique based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields.

2. Initialization:
   - Select an elliptic curve equation \( y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \) with parameters \( a \) and \( b \), along with a large prime \( p \) (defining the finite field).
   - Choose a base point \( G \) on the curve, which will be used for generating public keys.

3. Key Generation:
   - Each party selects a private key \( d \) (a random integer).
   - Calculate the public key as \( Q = d \times G \) (using elliptic curve point multiplication).

4. Encryption and Decryption:
   - Encryption: The sender uses the recipient’s public key and the base point \( G \) to encode the message.
   - Decryption: The recipient uses their private key to decode the message and retrieve the original plaintext.

5. Security: ECC’s security relies on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), making it highly secure with shorter key lengths compared to traditional methods like RSA.
